# Nodes

To manage node specific settings browse to <http://localhost:8080/gui/settings/nodes.html> or select the menu option *Settings -> Nodes*.

When you have several Enterprise Telemetry Monitor instances running on different kind of hardware the default [Cluster](cluster.md) settings might not be optimal for every node.
On the nodes configuration page you can fine tune node specific settings.

To configure a node, the node name must be the same as the instanceName configured in the [General configuration in etm.yml](../setup/node-configuration.md#general-configuration-in-etm-yml).
For a detailed description of the configuration options visit the [Cluster](cluster.md) chapter.
