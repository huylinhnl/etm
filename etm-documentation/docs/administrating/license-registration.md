# License registration
One of the first things you need to do as administrator is entering your license key. Without a proper license no events will be processed. When your license is expired or not entered you will be able to access all features of Enterprise Telemetry Monitor. The only part that is disabled is the processing of events.
To enter your license or view the state of your current license, open a browser and browse to <http://localhost:8080/gui/settings/license.html> (Of course your server name and port may be different). If you are already logged in to Enterprise Telemetry Monitor you can access the license page through the menu options *Settings -> License*.
Paste your license key in the input field and hit the *Apply* button. If you entered a valid license the license data will become visible.

A correctly applied license looks something like this:

**Enterprise Telemetry Monitor license**

Enterprise Telemetry Monitor can be used with a free license. When possible it will be automatically retrieved and applied. This license allows you to index 1000 event or 100 MiB every day. This free license will be valid for 7 days. Within the last 12 hours before the license will expire it will be automatically refreshed. If your server can't connect to the internet you can manually download the license from the [Jecstar website](https://www.jecstar.com/licenses/index.html).
