### Integration with JMS
Enterprise Telemetry Monitor is able to process messages from any JMS 2.x compatible message provider. To connect to the desired messaging system you have to add the JMS client jar files of the messaging system to the <INSTALL_DIR>/lib/ext directory of the Enterprise Telemetry Monitor installation.

For configuring the connections and destinations that should be read see the [JMS section in etm.yml](node-configuration.md#jms-section-in-etm-yml) chapter.
