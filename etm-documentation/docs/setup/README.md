# Setup
This section explains in detail the steps to download, configure and run an Enterprise Telemetry Monitor installation. Because Enterprise Telemetry Monitor is a pure Java application it should be able to run on any machine with a proper Java runtime installed. At a minimum a [Java 11](https://jdk.java.net/java-se-ri/11) runtime should be available. It is recommended to install JDK that comes with your default package manager, but Enterprise Telemetry Monitor might run with other JDK suppliers as well.

For the storage of the events Enterprise Telemetry Monitor relies on an [Elasticsearch 7](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch-oss) or compatible cluster. Both the Java runtime, and Elasticsearch cluster are not part of Enterprise Telemetry Monitor and need to be installed, configured and managed separately.
