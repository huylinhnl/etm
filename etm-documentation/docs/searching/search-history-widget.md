# Search history widget
Under the [Search template widget](search-template-widget.md) you'll find the Search history widget. This widget is a read-only widget and stores your last executed queries. By default your last 5 queries will be stored, but this value can be adjusted in your [User preferences](../user-preferences) screen. Keep in mind that an Enterprise Telemetry Monitor administrator is capable of setting a maximum number of queries that can be visible in your Search history widget.

The content of this widget is not bound to any session, so if you login via any other machine you will always see the same history.
