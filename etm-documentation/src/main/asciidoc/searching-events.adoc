So, you've set up your {etm} nodes and your processors are handling thousands of events per second. Now it's time to take advantage of the performance and simplicity {etm} has to offer.

To search through all events browse to http://localhost:8080/gui/search/ or select the menu option ''Search''. The first time you enter this page it looks similar to the image below.
